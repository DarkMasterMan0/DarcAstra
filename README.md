# D2RLAN Installation
Use Bonesy's D2RLAN mod manager to launch DarkAstra or other D2R mods, download it from here: https://www.d2rmodding.com/d2rlan After launching D2RLAN you can download DarcAstra using the `Download New Mod` button on the right side, select DarcAstra in the dropdown tab that appears and install. After installation select DarcAstra in the `Mod Choice` dropdown tab and click the `Play Mod` button.

**BACKUP YOUR SAVES OFTEN:** Any time your computer has a hard shutdown (crash, power outage, pulled plug, etc.) it will cause the active RAM to get corrupted which includes your currently active character and the respective shared stash (softcore/hardcore). You'll find your save files in `C:\Users\username\Saved Games\Diablo II Resurrected\DarcAstra`, you can backup the whole folder or just the `.d2s` (character) and `.d2i` (shared stash) files. D2RLAN has the option to automate backups, you'll find it under the `Options > QoL Options > Auto-Backup Characters` section.

# What is DarcAstra?
DarcAstra is a mostly vanilla (~90-95% vanilla) mod that aims to address some of the imbalances in vanilla D2R in regards to items and skills with a combination of nerfs, buffs, and other changes while attempting to maintain the "original feel" of the game. Some very minor changes to drop rates (some low level uniques being able to drop earlier and a new unique charm as a guaranteed drop from quest Hell Baal).

Some examples of the changes include buffs/changes to lots of the weaker sets and uniques (whether that be by increasing existing stats or adding new stats), a few buffs/changes to underused runewords (like Holy Thunder, Venom, and Wind) and nerfs to overtuned runewords (like Stealth, Spirit, Insight, Grief, Enigma, Mosaic outright removed, etc.), buffs/changes to underused skills (like Poison Dagger, Iron Maiden, and Defiance) and a few nerfs to overtuned skills (like Blessed Hammer and Holy Shield), changes to magic/rare item affixes (adding a maximum item level cap to lower tier affixes to trim down the affix pool at higher ilvls), and monster stat changes to assist physical characters (decreasing block chance of Act Bosses and Ubers [but increasing their defense to compensate], decreasing the level of Ubers, etc.).

DarcAstra is **NOT** designed for classic/non-expansion mode and does **NOT** support legacy graphics outside of a very few early mod changes (legacy graphics still work, it's just any new content with new graphics won't have graphics in legacy mode and will instead be invisible). Both of these are niche and I don't want to dedicate the effort in balancing/maintaining them.

Feel free to make your own changes, that's why I include the .txt files. :) If you decide to distribute your own version of DarcAstra then you must release it with your modified source code as per the GPL 3.0 license.
